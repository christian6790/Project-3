#from line 32-35 there is a function and the function is called "big" what this does is it plays the sample and after every play it sleeps 4 times.

#line 37-39 it is a live loop and that live loop is gonna play the sample over and over again continously.
#From line 22-line 41 this is where the live_loops come in and they play after the melody from line 5-line 19 and they play with eachother continuously
#from line 41-45 this is the sample that will play after the melody as sort as a bridge to the live loops and i have it play 48 times.
